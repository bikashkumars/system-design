## Design Principles
To ensure high availability, you need to follow some design principles that can help reduce the probability and impact of failures and increase the resilience and recovery of your system. These principles include redundancy, load balancing, replication, partitioning, monitoring, and testing. Redundancy provides multiple copies or backups of components or resources, load balancing distributes workloads among available components, replication maintains consistent copies of data across components, partitioning divides data into smaller units or segments, monitoring collects and analyzes data related to system status and performance, and testing verifies and validates system functionality. By applying these principles, you can design systems that can achieve high availability and handle various failure scenarios gracefully. However, it is important to consider the trade-offs and costs involved in each design decision before selecting the best option for your system requirements and constraints.
